Here I have built API's for CRUD operations performed in an task manager application and have build the followibg RESTful API endpoints:

1. GET /tasks: Retrieve all tasks
2. GET /tasks/:id: Retrieve a single task by its ID
3. POST /tasks: Create a new task
4. PUT /tasks/:id: Update an existing task by its ID
5. DELETE /tasks/:id: Delete a task by its ID
